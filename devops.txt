The goal of Continuous Delivery is to enable a constant flow of changes into production via an automated software production line. The Continuous Delivery pipeline is what makes it all happen. "Continuous Delivery is a small build cycle with short sprints"

Continuous Deployment, every change that is made is automatically deployed to production. This approach works well in enterprise environments where you plan to use the user as the actual tester and it can be quicker to release.

Continuous Integration is merging all code from all developers to one central branch of the repo many times a day trying to avoid conflicts in the code in the future. The concept here is to have multiple devs on a project to keep the main branch of the repo to the most current form of the source code, so each dev can check out or pull from the latest code to avoid conflicts.
